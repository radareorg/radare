SHORT

  radare is a commandline hexadecimal editor.


DESCRIPTION

  Radare is a toolkit framework for working with binary files having the
  unix philosphy in mind.

  It was born with simplicity in mind. The core of it remains on the
  command line hexadecimal editor that it aims to provide a helper
  tool for reverse engineering, exploiting, fuzzing, binary and data analysis.

  hasher is a hashing utility that allows to hash pieces of files and
  generate reports of changes. This is useful for hard disk analysis,
  reversing, binary diffs, system programs integrity, etc.

  radare comes with a set of IO plugins that wraps all open/read/write
  /seek/close/system calls. This way several plugins has been implemented:

    $ radare -L
    haret       Read WCE memory ( haret://host:port )
    debug       Debugs or attach to a process ( dbg://file or pid://PID )
    gdb         Debugs/attach with gdb (gdb://file, gdb://PID, gdb://host:port)
    gdbx        GDB shell interface 'gdbx://program.exe args' )
    shm         shared memory ( shm://key )
    mmap        memory mapped device ( mmap://file )
    remote      TCP IO ( listen://:port or connect://host:port )
    winedbg     Wine Debugger interface ( winedbg://program.exe )
    socket      socket stream access ( socket://host:port )
    gxemul      GxEmul Debugger interface ( gxemul://program.arm )
    ewf         EnCase EWF file support ( ewf:// )
    posix       plain posix file access

  Currently I'm working on a Vala frontend to provide an object oriented
  api for directly interfacing with the core of radare and provide a
  complete graphical frontend.


FEATURES

   rasc

   - shellcode helper tool
     - generates paddings with A's, nops, CCs and enumerations (00, 01, 02, ..)
     - most common use shellcodes hardcoded inside
       - x86 32/64, arm, powerpc
       - linux, bsd, solaris, darwin, w32
     - HOST, PORT, CMD shellcode alteration
     - syscall proxy server
   - output in
     - raw
     - hexpairs
     - C unsigned char array
     - execute shellcode (for local testing)

   rabin

    - show information about ELF/PE/MZ/CLASS files
      - entrypoint
      - imports
      - exports
      - symbols
      - libraries
      - sections
      - checksums
    - integration with radare core

   hasher

    - generates and checks block checksums of a file
    - can hash from stdin
    - supports multiple hashing algorithms
      - md4, md5
      - crc16, crc32
      - sha1
      - par, xor, xorpair
      - hamdist
      - entropy


   radiff 

    - integrates bdiff, bindiff, bytediff and rdbdiff into a single program
    - generates a raw binary difference between two files
    - recommended to use together with bdcolor
      $ bindiff a b | bdcolor 3


   rsc

    - contains helper scripts for working with binary files
    - asm/dasm - asm->hexpairs / hexpairs->asm
    - bdcolor  - colorizes and filters the bindiff output
    - bytediff - byte per byte binary diff (faster than bindiff, less accurate)
    - spcc     - structure parser c compiler
    - rfile-foreach - find magic signatures on a raw file
    - adict    - assembly dictionary
    - bin2txt  - generates a template text file with info and disasembly of a binary
    - bin2tab | tab2gml - generate a graphml with the program reference calls
    - syms-xrefs - find crossed references to each symbol of a binary
    ... and much more ...
