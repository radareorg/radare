  * Fix build for TCC (The Tiny C Compiler)
  * Fix some ugly pointer bugs thanks to tcc
  * The 64 bit mode works on 32 bits by offsetting it by 0x1 0000 0000 
    - this value is converted into seek 0xFFFFFFFF, but it is in reality
      the 0x100000000 position. You can relatively seek from there, so
      searchs and so should work for large files (512M?).
  * Fix compiler dependent things like defining variable size in local
    frames defining the size with a variable name. TCC does not predicts
    this size in realtime. Use malloc instead. Less optimal, but functional
  * Make sysproxy flaggable by configure (--with-sysproxy)
  * Fix anoying problem with the plugin handling list. This will allow us
    to easily add new plugins with the '-l' flag. So it will be able to
    dynamically load IO plugins from .so or .dll
  * Silendly add the new -l flag for adding plugins (not yet working, just
    initial code)
  * Reduce LOCs removing stupid comments and checks. Clean some warnings

    - bob$ radare sysproxy://alice:9999/bin/ls

  * Important fixups on the command parsing.
    - Now is possible to create your own oneliner debugger like this:
      > %PRINTCMD .!regs* && pD @ eip
      > pp
  * PRINT and VISUAL cmds does not alter the last_print_format
  * More stuff to stderr to avoid noise
  * Add 'y' and 'Y' commands into the shell


21: b07363de
author: pancake@dazo
date: 20071012-15:17:24

    - Range selection works also in the disassembly print mode, so
      you can yank (aka copy) and Yankee (aka paste) easily
  * Notify when not in write mode in visual mode
  * Fix showed bytes in udis print format

  * Yay: Now we have ;goto and ;loop <n> commands to move around history.
    This looks like a turing machine ;)
  * config.h has changed. make clean is recommended to avoid segfaults
  * Labels are now defined with ';<label-name>:' for example:
  
    > ;show-var:
  
  * Add label_get and label_show functions. this is all done from history.c
    so they can be static.
  * Add '!l' command to list all labels
  * Loop break (;break)
  * Add '!+' and '!-' commands to enable/disable execution (history.c)
  * Add ';hdump <file>' and ';hload <file>' to dump/load session history
    This can be used to load scripts

54: 2ffa5757
author: pancake@dazo

  * Fix the %COLUMNS weirdness. Use winsize structures.
    On visual mode an alarm is scheduled to automatically resize
    the terminal providing a better look and feel
  * Make HEXB fit better on %COLUMNS
  * Autodetect when radare is working with non terminal output (serial console)
    This is useful when you want to log a radare session easily.
  
    $ radare /bin/ls | tee log.file
  
    This way %COLUMNS are forced to be 80 at startup. You can redefine this
    by hand if you want :)
  * Split the drawing part from the input code. This way I can throw it from the alarm
  * Add history.c with lot of hiztory_ functions. This is a wrapper for the libreadline
    one, allowing you to emulate the history functionality in a better way without
    the need of libreadline.
  * This is dupped info, so in the future I plan to completely replace libreadline,
    or at least provide a minimalistic version if you want to link against libreadline,
    this will be good for the BSD family that uses libedit or so
  * Hijack '!h' command to show the history list
  * Reorder all print modes for nicer readibility (still shitty)
  * Colorize the rest of print modes. Maybe I should test it more and define new color
    palettes.
  
  


55: 42d92df3

  * Add arch_ret() and arch_call() functions to the debugger
  * Should be enought to build debugger-side code execution.
    Now i need breakpoint callbacks :) but this requires a better
    breakpoint infrastructure..will look on it

    but should build fine on arm


56: d081415d
author: pancake@dazo

  * Add 'stepo' command into the debugger
  * TODO: make stepo work over 'rep'z
  * Some minor VTE testing issues (needs more work)

  * Add 'jmp' command into debugger
  * Add command 'inject' to execute in-place code (rsc start2bin)

    This way, the debugger can get the flags. Cool for breakpointing :)
    > !bp sym_main

    * Initial import of the new binparser search engine (Thanks to esteve)
    
      The internals of the search engine has been changed completely, but the
      external command line interface remains backward compatible except for
      the removal of the buggy GNU regular expressions support. Mask searchs
      are not yet supported.
    
    * Autocomplete %SEARCH[
    * Support for multiple searchs in paralel
    * Support for binary regular-expressions-like syntax
    * Implemented a token grammar file format for storing search blocks in files (/.)
